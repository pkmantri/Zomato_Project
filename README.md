# 🍴 Zomato Data Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on **analyzing Zomato dataset** to uncover insights about restaurants, cuisines, ratings, and customer preferences. Using **Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, the project provides data-driven visualizations and patterns that can help food businesses and customers make informed decisions.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess the Zomato dataset.  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.  
- Identify patterns in **restaurant types, cuisines, ratings, and price ranges**.  
- Visualize findings with clear and interactive plots.  
- Provide **actionable insights** for restaurants and customers.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - Pandas (data manipulation)  
  - Numpy (numerical operations)  
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (data visualization)  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook  

## 📊 Key Analysis  
- Distribution of restaurant ratings.  
- Popular cuisines and their average ratings.  
- Cost distribution across different restaurants.  
- Correlation between restaurant type, location, and ratings.  
- City-wise restaurant analysis.  

## 📷 Sample Visualizations  
- Ratings distribution plots.  
- Cuisine popularity charts.  
- Heatmaps for correlation.  
- Bar and pie charts for cost & city analysis.  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zomato-data-analysis.git
   cd zomato-data-analysis
   ```
2. Install required libraries:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook and run:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Zomato Data Analysis.ipynb"
   ```

## 📈 Insights & Outcomes  
- Indian cuisine is among the most popular choices across locations.  
- High-rated restaurants tend to cluster around metro cities.  
- Cost for two is higher in premium restaurants but not always directly proportional to ratings.  
- Casual Dining and Quick Bites dominate the restaurant market.  

## 🔮 Future Scope  
- Build a **restaurant recommendation system** using ML.  
- Deploy interactive dashboards using **Streamlit/Power BI/Tableau**.  
- Enhance analysis with **real-time Zomato API data**.  

## 🏆 Project Value  
This project demonstrates:  
✔ Strong data wrangling and cleaning skills.  
✔ Ability to extract business insights from raw data.  
✔ Effective visualization and storytelling with data.  
✔ Practical application of Python for Data Analytics.
